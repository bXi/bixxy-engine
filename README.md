# Luminoveau

Luminoveau is a C++ library designed to simplify game development and creative programming.

## About

Luminoveau provides a set of tools and utilities to help developers build immersive experiences, from 2D games to interactive art installations.

## Key Features

- **Performance:** Designed for speed and ease of use, ensuring smooth gameplay and real-time interactions.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple and intuitive APIs make it easy to get started, while comprehensive documentation guides you through the process.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bXi/luminoveau.git
    ```

2. **Integrate with CMake:**
    Integrate Luminoveau directly into your C++ project using CMake. Here's an example of how to do this in your CMakeLists.txt file:
    ```cmake
    # We require C++17 as a minimum
    enable_language(CXX)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    
    # Add luminoveau as a subdirectory
    add_subdirectory(luminoveau)

    # Link your project with luminoveau
    target_link_libraries(your_project luminoveau)

    # Include Luminoveau headers
    target_include_directories(your_project PRIVATE luminoveau)
    ```

3. **Build Your Project:**
    Use CMake to build your project as usual. Luminoveau will be automatically included and linked.
    ```bash
    cd your_project
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Example program
  This is the bare minimum to get a window going.
  ```cpp
  #include "luminoveau.h"
  
  int main()
  {
    Window::InitWindow("Test");
  
    while (!Window::ShouldQuit()) {
      Window::StartFrame();
  
      Render2D::DrawRectangle({ 10, 10 }, { 50, 50 }, WHITE);
  
      Window::EndFrame();
    }
  }
  ```
